## Introduction
The Ship AR Experience is an innovative augmented reality application that allows users to place a highly detailed ship on flat surfaces using markerless tracking. The app offers an immersive experience where users can interact with various parts of the ship. By clicking on different anchors, users can virtually enter the ship and feel as if they are standing on it. The app also includes an interactive compass that reveals its internal components for inspection. Both the ship and the compass can be scaled, rotated, and placed on different surfaces, enhancing the flexibility and engagement of the experience.

## Features
- **Markerless Tracking:** Place the ship on any flat surface without the need for physical markers.
- **Immersive Environment:** Enter the ship by interacting with anchors, and experience a realistic and immersive environment.
- **Interactive Compass:** Inspect the internal components of the compass, which opens up for detailed exploration.
- **Scalable and Rotatable Objects:** Both the ship and the compass can be scaled and rotated, allowing for a customized viewing experience.
- **Multi-Surface Placement:** Easily move and place the ship and compass on different surfaces within the AR environment.

## Usage
1. **Setup and Installation:**
   - Build the apk file for Android or side load for the iOS devices.
   - Open the app and allow access to your camera for AR functionality.

2. **Placing the Ship:**
   - Point your device at a flat surface, and the app will automatically detect it using markerless tracking.
